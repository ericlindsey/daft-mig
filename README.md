Deformation and Faulting Toolkit: Modeling Interface for Geodesy (DAFT-MIG)

This repository contains (or will contain) a set of tools that enable straightforward modeling of surface deformation due to buried sources in the earth: Faults, magma chambers, viscoelastic domains, etc. The code integrates numerous published models and solutions for doing so, and provides a convenient interface to add new methods in the future.
